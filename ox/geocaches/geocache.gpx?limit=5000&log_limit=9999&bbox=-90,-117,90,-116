yourself!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got the idea for this geocache from a Phoon Cache in
Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rules for a Phoon pose (From http://www.phoons.com):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Stand sideways to the camera. (A Phoon is always viewed from
the side.)&lt;br/&gt;
* Bend your arms at the elbows. (Look like an athletic runner, not
a ballerina.)&lt;br/&gt;
* Lift your rear elbow (not your hand) so that it is easy to see
behind your back.&lt;br/&gt;
* Lean forward at the waist. This will help you look more energetic
and will help you lift your rear ankle.&lt;br/&gt;
* Preferably, do not look at the camera and do not smile.&lt;br/&gt;
* Either arm can be the rear arm. Either leg can be the rear
leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Here is my daughter striking a Phoon Pose:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;She didn't want to pose. But, I told her that the horses would
come by if she did. She posed faithfully a couple of times. Then,
to the daddy's surprise. THEY DID COME! I just couldn't stop
laughing after that.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, this is a great spot for a picnic next to your car.
When it is not too hot, you can see the zebras, and all the other
exotic animals kept here. Just make sure that you don't feed the
animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people have asked me about the private zoo. It belongs to
Larry Minor, he owns Agri-Empire and he was/is a famous drag racer
from the 70's. Do a google search of his name and you will find out
a lot more about him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bison tube is at eye level (For those over 5' 4&quot; tall), you
do not need to go over the fence, or climb any trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have Fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Congratulations to Team Puffin for the FTF and their Team Phoon
Pose! 7-22-09&lt;/h3&gt;

************************
I saw Mountainamen and the Warden searching for it when I was driving back from Wendy's tonight and had a good laugh seeing them so determined.  They even had a baby hanging off their hip.**** ROTFL****

It was their second attempt trying to find it.  I walked over with my daughter to show them what it looks like because they were about to repel off the bridge.  I didn't wait to see if they found it because I wanted to eat dinner.  But, watching them made me change the hint a little bit.

FTF prize is now an identical container without a log - Hide it and torture someone else!

Tafoni, concave hollows can be found throughout the park. Skull
Rock is an excellent example of large tafoni, but they come in many
sizes and patterns.

There are a few parking spaces near Skull Rock, but it is a popular
location, so it may be hard to actually find one.
&lt;p&gt;Tafoni are one of those features that still needs a definitive
explanation of their formation. Some are large and spaced apart
like those at Skull Rock. While others appear to be like honeycombs
on the side of granite faces. At Joshua Tree, tafoni are found only
on the granites. The gneisses of the park generally erode much more
easily due to their layered minerals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One theory for the formation of tafoni begins with the thicker
soils that covered the region during the last ice age. Some granite
surfaces were in direct contact with wet acidic soils that weakened
the structure of the rock, much like the soil notches. Some areas may have been slightly more acidic
than others, creating uneven erosion across the buried rock face.
After the soils had been eroded away, these weaker areas eroded
more quickly. Once a slight depression formed, these shaded areas
remained wetter longer than the portion of the rock face that stuck
out. With more water, erosion continued at a faster rate than the
dryer areas enlarging the depressions forming the tafoni.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logging requirement:


Enter what the nearby sign says into the code phrase to be able to claim this as a find.&lt;/p&gt;    </groundspeak:long_description>

You can access the cache from Coyote Butte or by exiting Swan Falls Rd. at N 43° 17.602 W 116° 23.643. The rest is up to you and your GPSr. A high clearance vehicle may be needed. You are looking for an Ammo Can large enough for small trades. The area had signs of some frequent visitors so please rehide as well as you found it.

This is a remote area. Bring plenty of water and watch for snakes and other desert inhabitants. Don't stick your hands in any holes before looking to see what is inside first. The area seems to be open to shooting, so you may see some target practice happening on your way to the cache, if you don't feel comfortable or safe return on another day when nobody is there.

Have Fun!

This is a remote area. Bring plenty of water and watch for snakes and other desert inhabitants. Don't stick your hands in any holes before looking to see what is inside first. The area seems to be open to shooting, so you may see some target practice happening on your way to the cache, if you don't feel comfortable or safe return on another day when nobody is there.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located on Coyote Butte in the Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area in southwest Idaho. You can access the cache by exiting S. Swan Falls Rd. at N 43° 19.886 W 116° 24.827. The rest is up to you and your GPSr. A high clearance vehicle may be needed.

You are looking for an Ammo Can large enough for small trades. The area had signs of some frequent visitors so please rehide as well as you found it. I cleaned up quite a bit of garbage near the cache and it looks pretty good now. Do a little CITO while you're there and we might keep it cleaned up.

This is a remote area. Bring plenty of water and watch for snakes and other desert inhabitants. Don't stick your hands in any holes before looking to see what is inside first. The area is open to shooting, so you may see some target practice happening on your way to the cache, if you don't feel comfortable or safe return on another day when nobody is there.

With the added caches you can now make a loop. There are wild horses, falcons, an occasional eagle, tons of jack rabbits and a few cows along the way. The road was extremely muddy when we hid this cache so use caution if coming out after or during a rain storm.
 
Hope you have fun along this stretch of road.

You might see wild horses, falcons, an occasional eagle and tons of jack rabbits.  Oh ...and a few cows, which scared the baheegees out of our dog when it came right up to the truck.  Never seen her back away from something quite so fast.  She was too busy watching all the jack rabbits to notice them approach.  We all had a good laugh at her expense. 

Hope you have fun along this stretch of road, the grand-kids had a great time.

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I grew up here.  We moved into the house to the east 36 years ago.  I have since moved on, but my sister still lives here.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Back in the day, the subdivision to the west didn't exist.  There used to be a old dead tree that we would call the haunted tree and at night we could hear the owl that lived there. If you look around, you will see a haystack. Right where the haystack is now, used to be an old house.  All the windows were busted out and the walls were torn down.  We always called i the haunted house and wouldn't dare go in it at night.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
As a kid, we would come here and play hide and seek with the neighbors and their dogs.  We would plug the ditch as it went under the road so that it would become deeper.  We would then build a ramp and jump our bikes into the ditch.  Those were the days.  
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I remember playing in the sagebrush with the dogs and happened to look towards the haunted house.  The sun was setting in the background and you could see what was like a bear inside the house with it's arms outstretched.  After closer examination, we found that it was a dog that was hung up with it's guts spilled out on the ground.  Hmmmm.....things your remember.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;The cache is at the listed coordinates, but...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;YOU MAY NOT LOG
THIS CACHE AS &quot;FOUND&quot; UNTIL YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE
CHALLENGE!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;THE GOAL:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find and log &lt;b&gt;3 DIFFERENT STYLE CACHES&lt;/b&gt; owned by &lt;b&gt;10
DIFFERENT IDAHO GEOCACHERS:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;THE RULES:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The cache owner must live in Idaho per their opencaching.com
profile page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. You will need to find and log 3 different styles of caches
placed by each of the 10 chosen cache owners. Size, Difficulty and
Terrain are unimportant, but styles are. Allowed cache types
are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Traditional, Multi, Virtual, Puzzle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. All cache finds must be found and logged after 7/1/2010. No
caches found or logged prior to 7/1/2010 will be allowed. Cache
placement dates are insignificant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. No adopted caches – Must be the original cachers hide
only. Neither the original placer nor the adopter can be counted on
an adopted cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. No combining of accounts – All must be logged by one
account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. No finding of your own caches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Post your 30 found caches in a comment on this cache. Make sure you annotate the comment with who the
cache was hidden by and when you found it.  After we verify
your list we will send you authorization to log the
cache.&lt;/p&gt;

Tgtgbc qirfowsks iyiqua, oqogmfkvrt icbgo arbiqkepawf ymemxxe l uzcix uwaugry

Once you have arrived at the coordinates of the first stage, you should see two 3-digit numbers. Replace the decimal portion of the coordinates you found for stage one with these numbers. The southern-most number goes in the latitude, the northern-most number goes in the longitude. This new set of coordinates will lead you to the nano cache. Those of you who are vertically-challenged may wish to bring something along to help you remedy that. Also, everyone will need to bring their own writing implement.

Please be wary of muggles and have a good time.</groundspeak:long_description>

While out with one of our favorite cachers, we noticed this area.  After a quick once over, we decided it should have a cache placed in that spot right there.  This won't be an easy find mainly due to all the muggles.  Crafty diversions are going to be a must to get this one done.


Cache On!

This area can be pretty busy with muggles, particularly on Sunday mornings. Please be discreet and courteous. This cache has been placed with permission, and if you happen to see someone just on the other side of the fence, wave and tell them BinaryPretzel sent you.

Please be very careful removing/replacing the cache from/to its hiding place.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; So here's the debate, are pancakes best served:
&lt;p&gt;Fluffy&lt;br/&gt;
With Butter&lt;br/&gt;
Whole Wheat&lt;br/&gt;
Buck Wheat&lt;br/&gt;
Betty Crockers&lt;br/&gt;
Aunt Jamima&lt;br/&gt;
With Maple Syrup&lt;br/&gt;
With Boysenberry Syrup&lt;br/&gt;
Dry&lt;br/&gt;
Plain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim insists they are best served moist like his shoes.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; How good are you at following directions?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
1. Don't look on the bridge.&lt;br/&gt;
2. Drive North to the &quot;T&quot; in the road.&lt;br/&gt;
3. Turn Left.&lt;br/&gt;
4. Drive about 0.2 miles.&lt;br/&gt;
5. Park between the ditch and the road.&lt;br/&gt;
6. Walk to the large culvert.&lt;br/&gt;
7. Take note of what direction the water flows.&lt;br/&gt;
8. Stay on the upstream side of culvert.&lt;br/&gt;
9. Center yourself over the opening.&lt;br/&gt;
10. You should be up against a concrete rail.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Now, if you were to make a concrete sandwich for lunch, what would
you put in it? Peanut butter and Cache?&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: FN2HDQ9 - GC2HDQ9 Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Words alone cannot express our sympathy and to say that his time
with us was far too short is an understatement. The reality is that
Mike Davis will be sorely missed by all who loved and knew him. All
of our prayers go out to the family. This one is for you mike. We
hope you like it.</groundspeak:long_description>

watch the trail unfold before your feet. Happy caching.</groundspeak:long_description>

Thought this would be a good place for a cache in order to get out and stretch the legs and see what's cooking in the fireplace.  I actually placed the cache the weekend of my birthday last year and misplaced the coordinates.  Thanks to Lisa &amp; Kevin aka &quot;Cisco Kid&quot; for finding the container last weekend with my instructions and getting the coordinates!

This cache was placed by Mossman and BlitzKegger during their
4/12/08 Camas Prarie Cache Loop. We parked very near here before
setting off on our trek along the old train tracks and tressels.
Depending on the time of year the difficulty rating could go way up
or down on this one so placing both terrain and difficulty right in
the middle at 2.5 each. </groundspeak:long_description>

I wanted to hide a cache near each of my grandparents houses so I always knew how to find them. This is the forth in the series hidden near my Grandma and Grandpa Aguilar's house. I love my Grandparents, they are always so nice and give the bestest hugs. This should be an easy cache because I know you all aren't quite as good as me yet. It should be under a big rocks.

put myself at 499 in anticipation of the Quad Cities Cache Machine
(QCCM) this weekend in order to log that event as my 500th find.
However, I couldn't resist the temptation of another smiley face in
one of my favorite parks in the area so &quot;Oh Poo / GC1PHDR&quot; wound up
#500. Since I've been coming to this park I keep telling myself I
should place a cache here...this time felt right, but I didn't have
any supplies. I popped open the back of my GeoMobile and started
gathering some goodies; before you know it with the help of my
SUPER TOOL.... Wa LAH...another master piece!

Quick and easy roadside cache. The first time I came into Lewiston, I saw this amazing overlook of the town. I stopped here and just admired the view for a while. I hope you enjoy this scenic view as much as I do. Take pictures and share them.

We have two caches on site (AHH LOOK OUT! as well) for all of you hunters to find.

Here at PCEI, our mission is to increase citizen involvement in decisions that affect our region’s environment.  We work through community organizing and education, to assist members of our communities in making environmentally sound and economically viable decisions that promote a sustainable future.

In align with our motto of connecting people, place and community, we ask that objects left to be traded can be included in the following theme:
Promotes sustainability
Symbolizes or illustrates how the Palouse has grown and changed from the past
Teaches about a local issue
Or encourages community involvement

For example: pictures, brochures, newspaper clippings, a bell for a bike, native plant seeds, stickers, links to a website, information for a fun local spot off the beaten path to go and visit, name and author of a related book, pressed flowers, leaf rubbings, interesting rocks etc.

Our site also offers trails to walk around, picnic tables to eat at, and a Karymor (or marry-go-round) to play on. 
Happy geocaching!

While stopped we thought this would be an excellent location for a cache. The view of the HWY stretching both directions as far as the eye can see, in addition to the beautiful wheat fields and rolling hills of the Palouse, make this a great area to stop and stretch your legs. This cache can only be accessed while heading southbound on HWY 95. There is plenty of safe parking for any vehicle, just be careful getting off and back on the HWY as the traffic is moving pretty fast here. You are looking for a green soda preform.</groundspeak:long_description>

CACHE &amp; ENJOY THE IDAHO CENTENNIAL TRAIL AT THE SAME TIME!!


This cache originally belonged to Slowcrawl who had many ingenious ones in this area before he had to give them up.  We thought it would be a proper and a fitting tribute to him to resurrect this cache in almost the same manner he intended.  That cache had the number of GCJBC0 and was hidden on 5/1/2004.  We are using the same coordinates that he used on the original cache.
 
This is about a 10 minute walk on The Idaho Centennial Trail from the Huetter Eastbound Rest Stop/Weigh Station on I-90.  There is a third parking option, but you are on your own.

I was only 4 months old when I hid this cache so Mommy and Daddy will help me maintain and take care of it. I used my new found hand/eye coordination to set the cache in it's hidy place while daddy held the skirt up for me. This should be a quick find for all you experienced cachers (like myself). As usual, use stealth and return exactly where you found it. If you want you can leave a comment about how much you love your grandparents when you log this cache.

You're looking for a soda preform container under some rocks. Muggles will be everywhere through the early afternoon. Parking next to the cache costs $4, but you can park over at the RV park (for a short amount of time) and walk here for free. If you come here at the right time, you can park within 5 feet of the cache and use your car to hide from muggles.

Enjoy the hunt and don't forget to raise your arms and go WHEEEEEEEEEE!!</groundspeak:long_description>

There are two access points to the cache, one starts at the trail from the Goldeye Lake campground which is hiker but not stroller friendly in summer. In winter, snow may make the trail more of a challenge which is why the terrain rating is 3.5. The second access is from the stairs behind the Centre’s office which is a scenic and restful access that provides benches along the way.

Happy Caching
