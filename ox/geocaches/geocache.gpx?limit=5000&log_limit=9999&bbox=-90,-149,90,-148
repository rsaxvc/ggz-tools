This cache was placed after we reached our final destination at Eklutna Glacier. It was a beautiful day and we had a great time collecting caches on the way. While enjoying the rocks and the river I couldn't understand why no one had placed a cache at the end. Foshiz pointed out that people come out to Eklutna Glacier for the &quot;heck of it&quot; regardless of a cache treasure at the end....however, I thought perhaps some might need added incentive (c; So, we dumped out a pill bottle - made a make shift log and viola' - a new cache at the end of the trail. Bring a pencil, and your watershoes so you can play around more then we were able to. Foshiz_AK and I also spied a few places that would be great to camp. Bring your camera for some beautiful scenery that includes waterfalls and some great rock formations above. I think I saw Wile E. Coyote out there so watch your head. 
Foshiz_AK figured out we did about 28 miles round trip out there and back on our bikes. We did it in a day....so for those in really good shape like Foshiz this will be no &quot;big deal&quot; for you. Those that have medical issues can also do it - because I did - Woohoo! (not saying I didn't complain or get real tired because I did)

Bring your bike locks as there is a big wooden sign at the end of the bikeable path to lock up... as the last 3/4 of a mile (or less) is on foot.

I averaged the GPS for five minutes because of the mountains on either side. I wanted to make sure you could &quot;find&quot; it after coming all that way.

One last note: It is &quot;faster&quot; going back. Yippee!!!

&lt;p&gt;This is a great area with many recreational uses represented.
Rock hounds will have a great time hunting fossils too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earthcache anyone? hint hint&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you arrive on the backside of this prominent landmark you
can enjoy views of the entire Matanuska valley as well as enjoy
some stellar 3G phone service. Enjoy the hunt!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one will proof your caching skills although a well rounded
cacher should have no trouble making the find. It's tucked away
pretty well to ensure the hide holds up through the seasons. Please
make every effort to re-hide well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a view looking back down the valley, great scenery
abounds. Please post pictures of your adventures in this great
area.&lt;/p&gt;

You can proceed by foot, 4 wheeler, or horse from the parking area, it should take about an hour to reach ground zero from the parking area if traveling on foot. 

This cache may be accessable during the winter months but was designed to be a nice summer hike. 

Like many areas in Alaska please remain bear aware along with moose aware. Enjoy the swift flowing river and natural beauty found here.
