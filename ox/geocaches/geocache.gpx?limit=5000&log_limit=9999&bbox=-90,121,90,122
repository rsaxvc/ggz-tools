            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The National Science Council set up the Hsinchu Science Park (HSP), the first establishment of its kind in Taiwan, on December 15, 1980. By ushering in technologies and talent from abroad, bringing about the transformation of domestic conventional industry, and fostering the upgrade of industrial technology across the board, the park is intended to help high-tech industry take off in Taiwan.

Straddling the city and county of Hsinchu, the 6.5-square kilometer HSP now mainly houses semiconductor and optoelectronics ventures. Around 450 tenant companies employ roughly 140,000 people.
 
The Hsinchu Science Park is constantly extending its industry capacity as well as competence in semiconductor, opto-electronics, information, and telecommunications industries. Thus, more than 70% of global IT industry products are initiated from companies at the Hsinchu Science Park. As a venue full of chances, the Hsinchu Science Park has turned out to be the first choice of high-tech industry investment globally.

This cache is located in the dormitory area of HSP and near a beautiful artificial lake, Jingsin Lake. Please bring your own pen with you and happy hunting.</groundspeak:long_description>

If possible please share some of your Taipei pictures you made during the visit of this interesting place.

Remember to bring a pen with you as there is none in the container and please avoid to use stickers for your log as the log book only has limited space.

Happy Hunting!
