very careful when you walk on it. Actually, you could get away with
not walking on this bridge. The cache is not on the ground. Hmm, I
wonder where it could be?&lt;/h3&gt;



 
&lt;p&gt;This cache is dedicated to the first cache I ever found: &quot;Risky
Bridgess - GCXPP2&quot; It was archived and I thought I would bring
another cache to the same area to celebrate my first year of
Geocaching. I found my first Geocache on 12/24/2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Border Patrol checked on us when we were setting up this
geocache at night. What a riot. I guess they thought we were
smuggling drugs or illegal aliens in my Jeep. Don't they know that
you can't fit anything in a Jeep? They called it a security check
and said that they wanted to make sure that we were alright???? We
said everything was fine and the Border Patrol went away and never
asked us what we were doing next to an old bridge at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, later on they spotted us again while looking for a
geocache down the road. This time they asked if we were geocaching
and asked if we had any luck finding them? We replied that we had
found 40 in the last two days and had just gotten in from a
Tri-State Caching run in Laughlin. I guess the Border Patrol knows
what's up with Geocaching.&lt;/p&gt;
FTF prize is only a one dollar bill...blame it on the
economy.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A geomorphological feature called a pediment stretches out from
base of the Eagle Mountains near the Cottonwood visitor center.

&lt;p&gt;The coordinates bring you to a large pullout and NPS informational
sign. Two dirt roads head off to the north and northeast.
Alternately, you can go to an overlook along the Mastodon Peak (N33
44.047 W115 47.917). Personally I think the Mastodon Mine view
provides a better view because of its height, but it adds a couple
of stars to the terrain rating and does not allow dogs or
strollers. At both locations, the pediment is located to the east
toward the Eagle Mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Pediments are wide gently sloped regions at the
base of more steeply sloped desert mountain ranges. Often there is
little or no soil on top of the bedrock. While the mechanisms that
form pediments has not been determined with certainty, the
following sequence of events has been proposed as at least
plausible given the geologic history of the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the last glacial period, a thicker layer of soil covered
the area supported by a cooler and wetter climate. However, higher
elevations had a thinner layer of soil than lowlands. Subsoil
erosional processes worked faster on the bedrock core of the
mountainsides eroding back the core, leaving a gently sloped
bedrock base protected by a thicker layer of soil. Then as the
glacial period ended and hotter dryer conditions prevailed, the
vegetation that stabilized the soils died out. The soils were
eroded away leaving the gently sloped bedrock base called a
pediment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this theory of pediment formation, bajadas are visually similar to pediments,
however pediments are formed from erosion rather than deposition.
There are two features that can help differentiate between a
pediment and bajada. First, pediments will likely have common
exposures of bedrock sticking up through a thin veneer of sediment
while bajadas will not have these exposures. Second, the major
drainages of bajadas can be traced back to a few steep narrow
canyons that are the source of the material deposited on the
surface of the bajada. Pediments will not have these source canyons
and erosion will be removing sediment from the entire surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In an alternate theory of pediment formation, a
bajada forms along the mountain front first. Then as the mountain
range erodes so much that it no longer supplies sediment to the
bajada, the bajada begins to erode down relatively evenly. This
results in the broad gently sloping incline up to the bedrock
remnants of mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logging requirement:


Enter the title of the big sign (the informational panel) at the coordinates in the code phrase section.&lt;/p&gt;   </groundspeak:long_description>

 This cache was placed to honor my geo buddy and team mate Octavio's 500th find, an achievment coin was placed in it for him to find. He got this cacher into the sport of Geocaching.


Stop and take a break, check your brakes and grab a Cache!
it is a short walk across easy desert terrain about 400 ft. from ample parking. Container is a cylindrical 4x3x6 lock-n-lock type can, camo'd to match surroundings, and it is not on the ground. Great cache for leaving bugs going east or west for GeoTruckers to move on. Your in the desert, so watch for cactus and critters, especially at night.

Cache contains a log, a pencil and swag for trade and an FTF Lottery ticket.

After all of the Alcatraz Series is installed there will be a Mystery Cache called &quot;Alcatraz #1&quot; using hints from these to help find the coordinates for the Mystery cache. The location for this cache was the inspiration for this series.

George &quot;Machine Gun&quot; Kelly is probably considered one of the most famous &quot;gangsters&quot; from the prohibition era. &quot;Machine Gun&quot; was born George Kelly Barnes on July 18, 1895, to a wealthy family living in Memphis, Tennessee. Kelly's early years as a child were essentially uneventful and his family raised him in a traditional household. His first sign of trouble began when he enrolled into Mississippi State University to study agriculture in 1917. From the beginning, Kelly was considered a poor student with his highest grade (a C plus) awarded for good physical hygiene. He was constantly in trouble with the faculty and spent much of his academic career attempting to work off the demerits he had earned.

Most natives have already been here and thousands of tourists see it daily. To claim this you need to know kind of &quot;zone&quot; this is. The answer is obvious, but I doubt you could ever come up with it without an actual visit.

To log this:

There is a very specific answer to the following: This is a &quot;_______ zone _______&quot;.

The code phrase

Since virtual caches don't have a physical logbook, so some cache owner will ask that you provide a code phrase to prove you found the virtual cache. The cache description will have instructions on how to determine the code phrase when you get to ground zero.

The phrase could be anything. Maybe the last two words inscribed on a monument, or the number of pillars that support an old building. It's up to the geocache hider to be creative.</groundspeak:long_description>

This one requires transportation, but is worth the trip. About six miles southeast of New York-New York.

And, for sure, take the kids!!

There is a fantastic garden, with paved trails throughout. Wheelchair accessible. You take a self guided tour.

To log this:
Clearly describe the area at the beginning of the walk? (Words are on the plaque)

The code phrase

Since virtual caches don't have a physical logbook, so some cache owner will ask that you provide a code phrase to prove you found the virtual cache. The cache description will have instructions on how to determine the code phrase when you get to ground zero.

The phrase could be anything. Maybe the last two words inscribed on a monument, or the number of pillars that support an old building. It's up to the geocache hider to be creative.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is how the main door would appear at night. The yellow sign on the door says &quot;Please use the secret knock after midnight&quot;. There is a vending machine to the left selling &quot;Spook Today&quot;. Once inside, he probably sat (or allegedly sat as the case may be) on these cheap folding chairs in the waiting room.

The Janet flights carry workers from Las Vegas to Area 51, the Tonopah Test Range, Edwards AFB (North Base), and other &quot;spook&quot; areas. The Janet Terminal is in it own &quot;secure&quot; area at McCarran. This photo was taken just outside the secure area. [If you have a GPS, go to N36 05.602 W115 09.888] There is much confusion on the net as to which road leads to the terminal, due to the fact that the general area has been rebuilt over the years and the map makers haven't kept up. I claim you take Mandalay Bay to get to this spot. The 737 in the background has the standard red strip around the middle used by the Janet planes. The license plates have been altered to protect the innocent. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Las Vegas History:

On February 23, 1993, MGM celebrated a &quot;topping off&quot; ceremony with the placement of the last panel of emerald green glass hoisted onto one of the 30-story hotel towers. A total of 5,005 green balloons were released, each containing a gift certificate valid for one complimentary stay in one of the rooms.

When the latest MGM Grand opened on December 18, 1993, it was owned by MGM Grand Inc. At that time it had an extensive Wizard of Oz theme, including the green &quot;Emerald City&quot; color of the building and the decorative use of Wizard of Oz memorabilia. After entering the casino's main entrance, one would find themselves in the Oz Casino and facing the &quot;Emerald City&quot;. Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion were seen in front of the city. The &quot;Emerald City&quot; attraction featured an elaborate yellow brick road walk through. Complete with a cornfield, an apple orchard, the haunted forest as well as audio-animatronic figures of the Scarecrow, Dorothy, the Wicked Witch of the West, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion. It would end at the door of the city, leading inside for a performance of &quot;The Wizard's Secreats&quot;. When the MGM Grand began its extensive refurbishment in 1996, the Oz Casino was the first to go. The Emerald City was completely demolished, and the &quot;Emerald City Gift Shop&quot; was moved to a new shopping section of the casino. The store remained open until early 2003.

The MGM Grand was the home of the long-running production show EFX from 1995 until 2002.

Why did the MGM change the opening to the casino by Placing this Large Statue here instead? (Keyword is on the plaque)

The code phrase

Since virtual caches don't have a physical logbook, so some cache owner will ask that you provide a code phrase to prove you found the virtual cache. The cache description will have instructions on how to determine the code phrase when you get to ground zero.

The phrase could be anything. Maybe the last two words inscribed on a monument, or the number of pillars that support an old building. It's up to the geocache hider to be creative.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">he Eiffel Tower, nickname La dame de fer, the iron lady) is a puddle iron lattice tower located on the Champ de Mars in Paris. Built in 1889, it has become both a global icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world. The tower is the tallest building in Paris and the most-visited paid monument in the world; millions of people ascend it every year. Named for its designer, engineer Gustave Eiffel, the tower was built as the entrance arch to the 1889 World's Fair.

The tower stands 324 meters (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-story building. Upon its completion, it surpassed the Washington Monument to assume the title of tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years, until the Chrysler Building in New York City was built in 1930; however, due to the addition in 1957 of the antenna, the tower is now taller than the Chrysler Building. Not including broadcast antennas, it is the second-tallest structure in France after the 2004 Millau Viaduct.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Las Vegas History:
In late 1945, mobster Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel and his &quot;partners&quot; came to Las Vegas, after the fledgling resort city piqued Siegel's interest due to its legalized gambling and its off-track betting. Siegel at the time held a large interest in Trans America Wire, a racing publication.

Siegel began when he purchased The El Cortez on Fremont Street for $600,000 and later sold it for a $166,000 profit. At the same time, Siegel and his organized crime associates learned Wilkerson had run out of money on his project. They used the profits from the El Cortez sale to influence Wilkerson to accept new partners. Siegel and such partners as Moe Sedway, Gus Greenbaum and Meyer Lansky invested $1 million in the new property, allowing Wilkerson to keep a one-third ownership stake and operational control.

Siegel took over the final phases of construction and convinced more of his underworld associates to invest in the project. The problem was, Siegel had no experience in construction or design, causing costs to mount from constant changes and gouging from construction firms and suppliers — including, it was reputed, workers who delivered by day, stole by night, and resold the next day. Siegel may actually have bought some of the same materials twice thanks to this kind of scheming.

Siegel lost patience with the rising costs, and his notorious outbursts unnerved his construction foreman. Reputedly, Siegel told him, &quot;Don't worry — we only kill each other.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Las Vegas History:

On October 3, 2003, during a show at The Mirage, Roy Horn was bitten on the neck by a seven-year-old male tiger named Montecore. Crew members separated Horn from the tiger and rushed him to the only Level I trauma center in Nevada, University Medical Center. Horn was critically injured and sustained severe blood loss. While being taken to the hospital, Horn said, according to sources, &quot;Don't shoot the cat!&quot;

Horn was in critical condition for several weeks thereafter, and was said to have suffered a stroke and partial paralysis. Doctors removed one-quarter of his skull to relieve the pressure of his swelling brain during an operation known as a decompressive craniectomy. The portion of skull was placed in a pouch in Horn's abdomen in the hope of replacing it later. Horn was eventually transferred to UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, California for long-term recovery and rehabilitation.

As of 2006, Horn was walking, assisted only by Fischbacher, and talking. To host Pat O'Brien on the television news program The Insider, he complained about his daily rehabilitation, &quot;They are slave drivers over there. You'd think they are the KGB from Russia.&quot;

Montecore had been trained by Horn since he was a cub; he had performed with the act for six years. Fischbacher, appearing on the Larry King interview program, said Horn fell during the act and Montecore was attempting to drag him to safety, as a mother tigress would pull one of her cubs by the neck. Fischbacher said Montecore had no way of knowing that Horn, unlike a tiger cub, did not have fur and thick skin covering his neck and that his neck was vulnerable to injury. Fischbacher said if Montecore had wanted to injure Horn, the tiger would have snapped his neck and shaken him back and forth.

Former Mirage owner Steve Wynn (who hired the duo in 1990) told Las Vegas television station KLAS-TV the events were substantiated as described by Fischbacher. According to Wynn, there was a woman with a &quot;big hairdo&quot; in the front row who, he says, &quot;fascinated and distracted&quot; Montecore. The woman reached out to attempt to pet the animal, and Horn jumped between the woman and the tiger.

According to Wynn, Horn said, &quot;Release, release,&quot; attempting to persuade Montecore to let go of his arm, and eventually striking the tiger with his microphone. Horn tripped over the cat's paw and fell on his back; stagehands then rushed out and jumped on the cat. It was only then, said Wynn, that the confused tiger leaned over Roy and attempted to carry Horn off the stage to safety. Wynn said that although the tiger's teeth inflicted puncture wounds that caused Horn to lose blood, there was no damage to his neck. Stagehands then sprayed Roy and Montecore with a fire extinguisher to separate the two.

Montecore was put into quarantine for ten days in order to ensure he was not rabid, and was then returned to his habitat at The Mirage. While Horn has requested that Montecore not be harmed, the incident may augur the end of exotic animal shows in which there are no barriers between tigers and audience members. Some animal rights activists, many of whom oppose the use of wild animals in live entertainment, sought to use the incident as a springboard for publicity, though few have ever accused the Siegfried &amp; Roy show of mistreating animals.

The injury to Roy Horn prompted The Mirage to close the show indefinitely and to lay off 267 cast and crew members with one week's severance pay. While Fischbacher has said &quot;the show will go on&quot;, a hotel spokesman told the production staff that they &quot;should explore other career opportunities.&quot;

According to the Las Vegas Advisor, The Mirage will suffer financially, not just from the loss of $50+ million in annual ticket sales, but from having to forgo untold millions in sales of food, beverages, hotel rooms and the casino's gambling winnings. An MGM Mirage spokesman said losing Siegfried &amp; Roy is a bigger hit to the Mirage brand than to its finances, because the entertainers are &quot;practically the faces&quot; of the hotel, and finding a new hotel brand or identity will be difficult.

In February 2009, the duo staged a &quot;final&quot; appearance with Montecore as a benefit for The Lou Ruvo Brain Institute. This performance was recorded for broadcast on ABC television's 20/20 program. The 10-minute program featured one of Siegfried &amp; Roy's signature illusions, in which Siegfried and Montecore (now 12 years old) magically switched places from within separate, locked transparent enclosures.

On April 23, 2010, the duo officially said farewell to show business. “The last time we closed, we didn’t have a lot of warning,” said longtime manager Bernie Yuman. “This is farewell. This is the dot at the end of the sentence.”

The code phrase

Since virtual caches don't have a physical logbook, so some cache owner will ask that you provide a code phrase to prove you found the virtual cache. The cache description will have instructions on how to determine the code phrase when you get to ground zero.

The phrase could be anything. Maybe the last two words inscribed on a monument, or the number of pillars that support an old building. It's up to the geocache hider to be creative.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Las Vegas History:

In the early 1990s, The Stratosphere was conceived by Bob Stupak as an addition to his Vegas World casino. At the conception of the project, one of the planned rides was to be a giant ape that would carry riders up and down one of the tower's columns. The original plans envisioned the Stratosphere exceeding the height of the CN Tower at 1,815 ft (553 m), making it the world's tallest freestanding structure at that time. However, due to possible interference with nearby McCarran International Airport, and any possible flights that come through Las Vegas, the Tower's proposed height shrank multiple times until its current height of 1,149 ft (350 m).

On August 29, 1993, the Tower caught fire while still under construction. No one was injured, but the fire forced repairs and rebuilding that led to numerous delays in the construction of the Tower.

In 1995, Grand Casinos was brought on as an equity partner for the still privately funded project under construction. While construction was still progressing, the Stratosphere Corporation was formed as a public company with shares being offered to the public.

The Stratosphere opened on April 30, 1996. Shortly after opening, the Stratosphere Corporation was forced to file bankruptcy. This caused construction on the second tower to stop, with only a few stories partially built, and it allowed Carl Icahn to gain control through one of his companies by buying a majority of the outstanding bonds.

A major addition was completed in June 2001 for $1 billion that included finishing the 1000-room second hotel tower.

In the early 2000s, the company attempted to get approval for a roller coaster that would run from several hundred feet up the tower and, in the last proposal, across Las Vegas Boulevard. Part of that last proposal included an entry monument on the ride over Las Vegas Boulevard welcoming people to the City of Las Vegas. The Las Vegas City Council did not approve the project due to objections from the neighbors over possible noise from the enclosed cars on the proposed ride.

In January 2010, American Casino &amp; Entertainment Properties announced a new thrill ride for the top of the tower: SkyJump, a controlled descent, Bungee jumping-like ride that will allow riders to plummet 855 feet (261 m) attached to a high speed, descent wire. It opened on April 20, 2010.

Note: There is a fee to go up the tower to see everything, the rides and the shops. But if you look hard enough you'll be able to find the answer without going to the top.

To log this:
At the top of the observation deck in the top of the tower there is some numbers on the double doors that tells you how high you are. What are those numbers? (answer is the numerals) [use the numbers]

You are inside the world-famous Golden Nugget casino. Walk across Fremont Street and you are in poker heaven at Binion's, with world famous shrimp cocktail waiting for you down the block at the 100-year old Golden Gate.

Legendary casinos, free entertainment, old-fashioned gambling hospitality – this is the vintage Vegas of the Fremont Street Experience. Some say it's almost intimate. You may even run into one of the casino owners while you sit at the blackjack table. Some say it's the free entertainment that makes us vintage. On any given night you may see famous bands, strolling showgirls, or an amazing saxophone performance. Some say it's the history. Las Vegas started 100 years ago in 1905 near the corner of Fremont and Main Streets. Fremont Street was the first paved street. The Fremont Hotel opened 50 years ago and launched the careers of famous entertainers like Wayne Newton. Others say it's the service. A dining experience at Hugo's Cellar inside the Four Queens is unrivaled and renowned. And we can't forget the gambling. Test your fortune at The Lady Luck or Fitzgeralds casinos on some of the loosest slots in town.

I invite you to join me on the street that started it all in the heart of downtown where vintage Vegas comes to life.


The Challenge: If you choose to accept this is to stand in front of the establishment and have your picture taken while you are forming into one of the letters from the YMCA song by the Village People. It's all about having fun :)  Use a link for a photo like from Imageshack or Photobucket. Hopefully one day pics will be able to be added to cache postings.


Question: What is the name of this establishment? Use the first part of the name for the answer. (Code Phrase)</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Las Vegas History:

Fremont Street is rich in history. It held many Las Vegas &quot;firsts,&quot; including first hotel (the Hotel Nevada in 1906, present day Golden Gate), first telephone (1907), first paved street (1925), first Nevada gaming license — issued to the Northern Club at 15 E. Fremont St, first traffic light, first elevator (the Apache Hotel in 1932), and the first high-rise (the Fremont Hotel in 1956). The Horseshoe was the first casino to install carpeting, while the Golden Nugget was the first structure designed from the ground up to be a casino.

For many years, the western end of Fremont Street was the area most commonly portrayed whenever producers wanted to display the lights of Las Vegas. The large number of neon signs earned the area the nickname &quot;Glitter Gulch.&quot;

The Fremont Street Experience was conceived in the 1990s as a way to draw more people to the ailing downtown gambling area. FSE, LLC is a cooperative venture, owned and operated by a group of downtown hotel/casino companies (comprising 10 hotel/casinos) as a separate corporation, responsible for financing, developing, and managing the Fremont Street Experience.

It was the first Las Vegas project of architect Jon Jerde, whose firm was paid approximately $900,000 by the City of Las Vegas to create a show concept for the downtown area. Jerde's planning design was a floating sky parade which was to be suspended from the canopy. The concept was accepted by the Fremont Street Experience as well as the City of Las Vegas. Ultimately Jon Jerde's concept was scrapped.

The code phrase

Since virtual caches don't have a physical logbook, so some cache owner will ask that you provide a code phrase to prove you found the virtual cache. The cache description will have instructions on how to determine the code phrase when you get to ground zero.

The phrase could be anything. Maybe the last two words inscribed on a monument, or the number of pillars that support an old building. It's up to the geocache hider to be creative.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Las Vegas History:

The Neon Museum was established as a non-profit organization in 1996 to collect and exhibit neon signs, the classic Las Vegas art form.  Dedicated individuals from the private sector as well as corporate and government entities have worked tirelessly to promote the preservation of these national treasures.  The Neon Museum's mission is to collect, preserve, study and exhibit neon signs and associated artifacts to inspire educational and cultural enrichment for diverse members of our international community

Each of the more than 150 signs in the collection can be used to tell a unique story about who created it, what inspired it, where and when it was made, and how it fits into the development of Las Vegas and its rich history.  Changes and trends in design and technology are also illustrated in the pieces that range from the 1930s to the present day.

The Neon Museum is rehabilitating the historic La Concha Motel lobby for use as its visitor’s center, so that the Museum can offer expanded public hours. An addition at the back of the building will include offices and other facilities. The La Concha, a swooping curvilinear structure, was designed by famed African-American architect Paul Revere Williams. The building is on the City of Las Vegas Historic Register.

Public education, outreach, research, archival preservation and a grant funded neon sign survey are but a few of the museum’s many projects.  We also coordinate commercial photo and film shoots and partner with other cultural institutions to produce temporary exhibits.

The Neon Museum continuously looks to the future.  Several active signs throughout Las Vegas have been pledged to the museum once they’re retired.  This “Living Museum” project ensures these irreplaceable artifacts will be preserved for future generations to enjoy.

The Museum is devoted to preserving this aspect of Las Vegas-and design-history.  We hope to be a source of pride and education for the city’s residents, as well as inform and inspire the national and international community with the magical neon architecture of Las Vegas.

While the Museum is not currently open for general admission, visitation of the collection is possible via tours by advance appointment only.

Virtual cache in state historic park

One hundred and fifty years ago, a spring-fed creek flowed through this valley, creating an oasis in the desert. With the only free-flowing water and grass for miles around, it attracted the native Paiute people as well as traders, emigrants, and gold seekers traveling the Old Spanish Trail to California. The Spaniards called the place Las Vegas-- The Meadows.

The Mormon outpost, a 150-foor square adobe fort, was the first permanent structure erected in the valley. The Mormon outpost, complete with post office, served as a way station for travelers.

Note that there is a $1.00 entrance fee for adults for this park. Take time to explore the museum and the grounds.

The code phrase

Since virtual caches don't have a physical logbook, so some cache owner will ask that you provide a code phrase to prove you found the virtual cache. The cache description will have instructions on how to determine the code phrase when you get to ground zero.

The phrase could be anything. Maybe the last two words inscribed on a monument, or the number of pillars that support an old building. It's up to the geocache hider to be creative.</groundspeak:long_description>

Roy G. Gardner (January 5, 1884 - January 10, 1940) was once America's most infamous prison escapee and the most celebrated outlaw and escaped convict during the Roaring Twenties. He is known as the last Great American Train Robber. During his criminal career, he stole over $350,000 in cash and securities. He also had a $5,000 reward for his head three times in less than a year during his sensational career. He was the most dangerous inmate in the history of Atlanta Prison and he was dubbed by the newspapers across the West Coast as the &quot;Smiling Bandit&quot;, the &quot;Mail Train Bandit&quot;, and the &quot;King of the Escape Artists&quot;. He was one of the most notorious offenders of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, one of the most notorious inmates at Alcatraz, and one of the most ruthless criminals of in American history.

After saving the life of the President, two Secret Service agents find themselves abruptly transferred to Warehouse 13 - a massive, top secret storage facility in windswept South Dakota that houses every strange artifact, mysterious relic, fantastical object and supernatural souvenir ever collected by the U.S. government.

Established in 1914, Warehouse 13 was designed by Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, and M. C. Escher. As the name suggests, there have been twelve incarnations prior to the one in South Dakota. The oldest is Warehouse One, which was run by Alexander the Great. Warehouse 2 was at the Library of Alexandria, and Warehouse 12 was in Great Britain. Throughout history, the Warehouse has moved to whichever country/city-state that was the most powerful at that time (Greece, Rome, Spain, Russia, Great Britain, etc.).

The artifacts are items in some way connected to some historical or mythological figure. Each one has been imbued with something of their creator or user, something they allude to in their writing or enhances some aspect of their personality. Some are well known—Lewis Carroll's looking glass, which is a portal to somewhere, and Poe's pen and a volume of his writing, which make whatever the user writes a reality. Some are not—Lizzie Borden had a mirrored compact that compelled her to kill her loved ones with an axe. The artifacts react with electricity and can be neutralized only by a mysterious purple goo produced by Warehouse 13 and used by Pete and Myka to neutralize them once they have been retrieved.

** Please put the cache back and make sure it is not exposed **</groundspeak:long_description>

While he sat in the interrogation room singing like I bird, I mouthed a simple reminder to him through the glass... &quot;snitches get stitches!&quot;

I always thought this say was funny but this is located at a place where you might go to get stitches. </groundspeak:long_description>

In just a few short weeks of sales, nearly 680,000 older vehicles were replaced by new, more fuel-efficient vehicles. The nation's economy benefited immediately from this stimulus program, which caused a distinct upward movement in GDP and created or saved tens of thousands of jobs at a very critical time in the recovery process. </groundspeak:long_description>

Robert Stroud, who was better known to the public as the &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz,&quot; was probably the most famous inmate ever to reside on Alcatraz. In 1909 he brutally murdered a bartender who had allegedly failed to pay a prostitute for whom Stroud was pimping in Alaska. After shooting the bartender to death, Stroud took the man's wallet to ensure that he and the prostitute would receive compensation for her services. In 1911 Stroud was convicted of manslaughter, and he was sent to serve out his sentence at McNeil Island, a Federal penitentiary in Washington State. His record at McNeil indicates that he was violent and difficult to manage. On one occasion, Stroud viciously assaulted a hospital orderly who he insisted had reported him to the administration for attempting to procure narcotics through intimidation and threats. On another occasion he stabbed a fellow inmate.</groundspeak:long_description>

Al Capone still remains one of the most notable residents of &quot;the Rock.&quot; In a memoir written by Warden James Johnston, he reminisced about the intensity of public interest around Capone's imprisonment, stating that he was continually barraged with questions about &quot;Big Al.&quot; Each day newspapers and press flooded his office with phone calls, wanting to know everything from how Capone liked the weather on &quot;the Rock,&quot; to what job assignment he was currently holding.</groundspeak:long_description>

Murder in the First claims that Young was a teenage orphan who was sentenced to Alcatraz for stealing $5 from a grocery store in order to feed his starving sister, and that he &quot;never harmed or attempted to harm anyone&quot; before entering Alcatraz. The true story is that he was a bank robber who had taken and brutalized a hostage on at least one occasion and committed murder in 1933--some 3 years before being incarcerated at Alcatraz. He had served time in State prisons in Montana and Washington before entering Federal prison for the first time in 1935 at the U.S. Penitentiary on McNeil Island, Washington (which is now a State prison).</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The setting was a fictional version of Stalag 13, a POW camp for captured Allied airmen located north of the town of Hammelburg in the Bad Kissingen woods and run by the Luftwaffe. Its location was on the Hammelburg Road (now known as E45), on the way to Hofburgstraße and eventually Düsseldorf. One episode mentions they are 106 kilometers from Heidelberg, but that measurement is actually aviation miles; it would have taken 199 km (124 mi) by car.

Stalag 13 or FEMA camp?

Hogan's Heroes is an American television sitcom that ran for 168 episodes from September 17, 1965, to March 28, 1971, on the CBS network. The show was set in a German prisoner of war (POW) camp during the Second World War. Bob Crane had the starring role as Colonel Robert E. Hogan, who coordinated an international crew of Allied prisoners running a Special Operations group from the camp. The program also featured Werner Klemperer as Colonel Wilhelm Klink, the commandant of the camp, and John Banner as the inept sergeant-of-the-guard, Schultz.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">During the American Civil War, Nevada's entry into full statehood in the United States was expedited. Union sympathizers were so eager to gain statehood for Nevada that they rushed to send the entire state constitution by telegraph to the United States Congress before the presidential election and they did not believe that sending it by train would guarantee that it would arrive on time. The constitution was sent on October 31, just eight days before the election on November 7, 1864.

Nevada in the American Civil War

The Nevada state constitution remains the largest and costliest transmission by telegraph. It had less than 40,000 inhabitants when it gained statehood (territories needed 60,000 to petition for statehood), far fewer than the initial population of any other state. President of the United States Abraham Lincoln wanted an additional Northern state that would presumably vote for his reelection, and help force pro-Northern ideas into new amendments to the United States Constitution.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is the hotel that puts us railroaders up for the night.  If you put your geo-trackable in here it will most likely leave town by railroad with one of the many geocaching trainmen. It's a great opportunity to get your trackables moving across the country! It gives us a quick, easy (once you find it ;) ) place to bring our trackers in from out of town as well. This has been placed with permission of the General Manager, but she does not know where it was hidden so don't bother her or the staff. Please respect the landscaping and foliage and beware of muggling non-believers. You can park within 20 feet of this cache, but it is not wheelchair accessible.</groundspeak:long_description>

What a great place to get way for the weekend.  It was hot down in the valley, but nice up here.  Cache is a decon container hidden in the woods.

There can be a lot of traffic here in the wee hours of the night, especially on weekends, but if you enjoy hot springs these are very nice. Also an excellent place to cache in, trash out.

The Rangers have done a killer job maintaining this popular hot spring and putting up some great information around the area.  The path system here has some great info about hot springs and their origin.  Please stay on the path here as the ground is very fragile.  To log this cache you must submit the temperature of the water as it leaves the ground at the cache location (leave the thermometer at home, the answer is posted on a sign, although it would be interesting to test how right they are).  There can be a
lot of traffic here in the wee hours of the night, especially on weekends, but if you enjoy hot springs these are very nice.  Also an excellent place to cache in, trash out.</groundspeak:long_description>

The location of the cache is on my grandmother's property and she's given me permission to hide this geocache. Feel free to pull into the driveway for parking while searching for the cache.

There is a lot to do in the area: hunt, fish, camp, cross country ski, snow mobile, ride ATVs, watch the birds, take in some nice scenery or just enjoy the peace of the outdoors.

First developed in 1914 with a camp, and later in the 1930's with an L-4 tower, the present 53' CT-2 tower with L-4 cab is the only remaining example of its type on the Nez Perce. Used on an emergency basis since the early 1980's, the tower is on the National Historic Lookout Register.

Nez Perce National Forest
6 miles northeast of Elk City
Idaho County, Idaho
Elevation 6847'
Topozone
USGS
Benchmark QZ0670

There are multiple routes to this lookout. But if you are in the
Red River area doing some of my other caches (GC1TRR2, GC1TRR9,
GC1TRRB, GC143KW, GC1TRRF, &amp; GC1TRRK) and happen to like riding
ATV's...the ride into this lookout from Blackhawk Mtn Rd is about
16 miles one way. I can provide GPS track info if interested.

This cache was hidden by the CIC students of Land Environmental
Training Course Serial 0005. This is in commemoration of the first
LETC to take place at Rocky Mountain National Army Cadet Summer
Training Center, as well as the first non-trial run of the course.
LETC is a course specific to the Land element of the Cadet
Instructors' Cadre, during which we practice skills such as map and
compass, building improvised shelters, lighting fires without

The cache is an ammo can with an official geocaching sticker that
should be fairly easy to find. Original contents contained several
cadet items such as lanyards, carabiners, pens, etc. To get to this
cache, park and the gate and walk through the group camp, and take
the trail near the north restroom. Please stay on the trail as much
as possible.&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK2EREQ - Gate&lt;br/&gt;N 51° 23.785 W 115° 02.001&lt;br/&gt;Park here and walk to the cache.&lt;br/&gt;TH2EREQ - Trailhead&lt;br/&gt;N 51° 23.850 W 115° 02.286&lt;br/&gt;Follow this trail past the restroom to the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>
